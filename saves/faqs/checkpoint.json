    "title": "Can you please add a code for `x` game?",
    "value": "Nobody on the FlagBrew team knows how to make gameshark codes, or wants to learn. All of the codes were either taken from a fort42 dump, or submitted to the repo. If you want more codes, learn how to make them yourself, or find a working one and open a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/Flagbrew/Sharkive/pulls) to get the code added."

    "title": "Why won't Sharkive launch?",
    "value": "Sharkive has been deprecated as its functionality has been merged into [Checkpoint](https://github.com/FlagBrew/Checkpoint/releases/latest). Use Checkpoint instead."
  },
  {
    "title": "Why isn't my game showing up in Checkpoint?",
    "value": "There could be a few reasons.\n1. Make sure you have save data in the game. Checkpoint requires a save archive to locate a game.\n2. The game might save solely in ExtData. Press `X` and make sure it's not showing up there.\n3. Reload your titles using `B`. If you loaded Checkpoint before saving in game, you'll need to do this as Checkpoint doesn't check titles at each launch."
  },
  {
    "title": "Why am I having issues using Checkpoint under applet mode?",
    "value": "Applet mode isn't supported, as it doesn't give enough memory. Use Atmosphere's title takeover feature (launch game holding R) instead."
  },
  {
    "title": "I'm having issues using cheats with SUMO and USUM",
    "value": "This is due to a kernel bug. Luma's cheat engine would need to be redesigned to fix this, which would cause another bug elsewhere. As such, there is no solution to this problem at this time besides using another console."
