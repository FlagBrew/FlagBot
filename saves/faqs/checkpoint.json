If you want more codes, learn how to make them yourself, or find a working one and open a pull request on the [repository](https://github.com/Flagbrew/Sharkive/pulls) to get the code added."

        "title": "Why isn't my game showing up in Checkpoint?",
        "value": "There could be a few reasons.\n1. Make sure you have save data in the game. Checkpoint requires a save archive to locate a game.\n2. The game might save solely in ExtData. Press `X` and make sure it's not showing up there.\n3. Reload your titles by holding `B`. If you loaded Checkpoint before saving in game, you'll need to do this as Checkpoint doesn't check titles at each launch."

        "value": "Applet mode isn't supported, as it doesn't give enough memory. Use Atmosphere's title takeover feature (launch game holding R) instead."
